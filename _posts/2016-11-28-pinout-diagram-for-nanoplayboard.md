[Alberto][1] (aka [@PighiXXX][1]) has developed an awesome pinout diagram for **NanoPlayBoard**.

The [pdf][2] with the pinout is available on [his website][3], where you can find the pinouts of the most popular microcontrollers.

We would like to **thanks** to [Alberto][1] for his contribution to the project.
